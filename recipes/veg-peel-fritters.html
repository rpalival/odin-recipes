    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Chickpea flour</li>
        <li>Chilli powder</li>
        <li>Ground cumin</li>
        <li>Nigella seeds</li>
        <li>Turmeric</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>vegetable peelings</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a deep saucepan over a medium-low heat, ensuring it is no more than two thirds full. Pour 100ml of water in a bowl and mix with the egg. Tip in the gram flour, baking powder, spices and 1 tsp fine sea salt, then stir until a thickish paste forms. Stir in the vegetable peelings and onion. Add another splash of water to loosen if needed.</li>

        <li>To check if the oil is hot enough, drop in a tiny speck of batter. If it rises to the surface surrounded by bubbles and starts to brown, the oil is hot enough for frying. If not, increase the heat to medium-high. Once hot enough, carefully lower heaped tablespoons of the mixture into the oil, a few at a time, then flatten with the back of the spoon. Cook for a few minutes, turning once, until evenly browned and crisp, about 3-4 mins. Drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with a little salt. Serve warm with lime pickle, mango chutney and raita.</li>
